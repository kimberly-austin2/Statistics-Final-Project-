# Statistics-Final-Project-
For this project, I analyzed the relationship between Taylor Swift song plays versus Taylor's Version song plays, to see if genre and type of song affects the popularity of the song itself. There are many variables that could affect the plays of a certain song, but genre, type of song, and whether its Taylor's Version or Original version affects Taylor Swift's plays the most. 
To operationalize the data, I organized the data into different categories in a tabular format. The categories are type_song, genre, plays_TS, and plays_TV. I then collected my quantitative data off the website songstats.com, comparing the numerical number of plays a taylor swift song versus a taylor's version song has. I then categorized the qualitative variables with a code book (below).
To clean my data, I went through and checked all of the numbers to make sure they were correct, but still ran into an error when I created my linear regression graph. Due to a mistyped number, there was a large outlier that affected the entire plot. So, I went thorugh and cleaned the data once more, and there are now no more errors. To clean the qualitative variable data, I went through and reran all of the categories to make sure they aligned with the original data. I had little to no issues when cleaning my data. 
To access and utilize the package, go to positcloud.com and open a new project. Then, take the posit cloud.pdf and copy and paste it into the console. Then, upload the raw_data.csv and load the data. Run all of the packages. Then, compare the graph to theb graphs shown in the graphs.pdf to ensure that there were no errors.
